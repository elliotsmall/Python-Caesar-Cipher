# Python Caesar Cipher
Welcome to my Caesar Cipher project. This is my first program written in python. The steps to using my program goes as follows:
1) The user decides to either Encrypt or to Decrypt a string
2) The user enters the string that wish to either encrypt or decrypt.
3) The user enters the key that they wish to shift by.

Following these inputs, the program goes character by character, shifting each letter by the key that they entered.

Some future plans for this project include:
1) User input validation
2) Create a website for this program
3) Add more types of ciphers/encryption types, as well as desciption pages to help educate users about the different kinds of cryptography.
